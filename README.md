# magicavoxel-launcher

A simple launcher for MagicaVoxel that allows you to select a folder as a workspace and then open the program with that workspace.

</p>

It is useful for those who want to keep their MagicaVoxel files organized in different folders (e.g., one folder for each project).

## How it works 🛠️

When you select a folder as your workspace, the launcher will edit the `config.txt` file (and make a backup of the original file) to set the workspace to the selected folder. Then, it will open MagicaVoxel with the edited `config.txt` file.

## Installation 📦

You can download the latest version of the launcher from the [releases page](https://github.com/Kan-A-Pesh/magicavoxel-launcher/releases).

## Usage 🚀

Simply run the launcher and select a folder as your workspace. The launcher will then open MagicaVoxel with that workspace.
